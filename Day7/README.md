# 🚀 Day 7 – AWS DevOps Project

## 🎯 Goal

Set up a complete **CI/CD Pipeline** for a sample Node.js application using  
**AWS CodePipeline**, **CodeBuild**, and **CodeDeploy**.

By the end of this task, you’ll understand how AWS handles **automated builds, deployments, and integrations** — just like in real DevOps projects!

---

## 🧠 Concepts to Learn

### 🧩 AWS CodePipeline
AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed **continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)** service that helps you automate your build, test, and deploy phases whenever code changes occur.


### 🧩 AWS CodeBuild
AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed **build service** that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy artifacts.


### 🧩 AWS CodeDeploy
AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to EC2, Lambda, or on-premises instances.


---

## 🛠️ Project Overview

You will create a **CI/CD pipeline** that automatically deploys a Node.js web app from  
**GitHub → CodePipeline → CodeBuild → CodeDeploy → EC2.**

**High-level architecture:**

```
GitHub → CodePipeline → CodeBuild → CodeDeploy → EC2
```

---

## 📋 Tasks to Perform

### 🪜 Task 1: Prepare Source Code

- Use a simple Node.js application (you can fork any sample from GitHub or create your own).
- Add a `buildspec.yml` file at the root for CodeBuild instructions.


---

### 🪜 Task 2: Create an S3 Bucket for Artifacts

- Create an **S3 bucket** to store build artifacts generated by CodeBuild.
- Enable **versioning** for safe rollback of builds.

---

### 🪜 Task 3: Create a CodeBuild Project

- Connect CodeBuild to your **GitHub repository**.  
- Choose **Node.js runtime** in environment settings.  
- Use the **same S3 bucket** for build artifacts.  

---

### 🪜 Task 4: Configure CodeDeploy

- Launch an **EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2)** with an **IAM Role** that has CodeDeploy permissions.  
- Install the CodeDeploy agent on EC2

- Create an `appspec.yml` file in your repo to define deployment steps:


---

### 🪜 Task 5: Create CodePipeline

- Go to the AWS Console → **CodePipeline**.  
- Choose:
  - **Source:** GitHub  
  - **Build:** CodeBuild project you created  
  - **Deploy:** CodeDeploy app & deployment group  
- Run the pipeline and observe your automated deployment to EC2.  

---

## 🧩 Bonus Task

- Add a **Slack or SNS notification** for each pipeline stage (Success/Failure).  
- Use **CloudWatch Logs** to monitor your builds and deployments.
