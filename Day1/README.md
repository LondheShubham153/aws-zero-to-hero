# ☁️ Day 1 – Introduction to Cloud & AWS Basics

Welcome to **Day 1** of the **7 Days of AWS Challenge** 🚀  
Today, you'll start by understanding *how cloud computing works*, the *different pricing models AWS offers*, and the *journey of AWS* from its beginnings to becoming the global cloud leader.

## 🎯 Tasks for Day 1

1. **Understand AWS Pricing Models**
   - Learn about the different pricing models offered by AWS (Pay-as-you-go, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, etc.).
   - Write a short summary post on LinkedIn *in your own words* explaining which pricing model you think is most useful for startups or learners.
   - Tag [@TrainWithShubham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhamlondhe1996/) and use hashtags **#7DaysOfAWS** and **#AWSwithTWS**.

2. **Compare Cloud Models**
   - Differentiate between **On-premises**, **Cloud**, and **Hybrid** models.  
   - Write when each model is most appropriate (e.g., startups, enterprises, government projects).
   - Bonus: Create a small diagram or table and include it in your LinkedIn post.

3. **Explore Service Models**
   - Learn about **IaaS**, **PaaS**, and **SaaS** with 2–3 examples for each.
   - Explain how AWS provides these services (e.g., EC2 = IaaS, Lambda = PaaS, WorkMail = SaaS).

4. **AWS History & Key Milestones**
   - Learn about the *evolution of AWS* — when it started, its major launches (like EC2, S3, Lambda, etc.), and how it became the #1 cloud provider.
   - Share 3–4 key milestones as a carousel or post on LinkedIn.
